# IAmStuckOnThisBCISawWhatYouWantedInApril2017-ItWasGenuine-IRememberThat-IGetIt

i never trusted anything that happened after we met in april 2017, it always seemed off, but i was like ... i cant do anything, my intuition all summer 2017 was like 1. something weird happened with that job not happening 2. someone is after me, i cant prove it, i cant explain, but something weird is happening and i was right

that summer 2017, my windshield on my car exploded, bc the guy who was trimming the hedges said he didnt touch my car that was parked, and i swear i was like somebody is doing like voodoo shit on me or SOMETHING is going on that i cant explain -- that was so weird that happened
