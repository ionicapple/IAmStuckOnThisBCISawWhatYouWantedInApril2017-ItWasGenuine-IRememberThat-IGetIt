# IAmStuckOnThisBCISawWhatYouWantedInApril2017-ItWasGenuine-IRememberThat-IGetIt

i never trusted anything that happened after we met in april 2017, it always seemed off, but i was like ... i cant do anything, my intuition all summer 2017 was like 1. something weird happened with that job not happening 2. someone is after me, i cant prove it, i cant explain, but something weird is happening and i was right

that summer 2017, my windshield on my car exploded, bc the guy who was trimming the hedges said he didnt touch my car that was parked, and i swear i was like somebody is doing like voodoo shit on me or SOMETHING is going on that i cant explain -- that was so weird that happened

and then when i would write to u, 2018-2019 i was like SOMEONE is keeping u from seeing me, i dunno who but im going to figure it out, i had to figure it out bc it was personal ... i figured who ever it was, wanted to attack me personally, not professionally (tho its both), but at the personal level that what i knew

thats why i believe this https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&action=history all the updates, i believe it for what it is, 100% its in response to us meeting, everything

the thought/intuition that i had in my head summer 2017 was "something really bad happened" -- thats why i believe this whole thing

i wasnt thinking of penn at all tho bc i wasnt there anymore! i returned everything in feb 2017 so like that would be crazy if i was thinking of those losers in like june 2017 in new jersey ... right
