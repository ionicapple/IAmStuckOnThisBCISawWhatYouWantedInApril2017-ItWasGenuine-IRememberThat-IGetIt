# IAmStuckOnThisBCISawWhatYouWantedInApril2017-ItWasGenuine-IRememberThat-IGetIt

i never trusted anything that happened after we met in april 2017, it always seemed off, but i was like ... i cant do anything, my intuition all summer 2017 was like 1. something weird happened with that job not happening 2. someone is after me, i cant prove it, i cant explain, but something weird is happening and i was right

that summer 2017, my windshield on my car exploded, bc the guy who was trimming the hedges said he didnt touch my car that was parked, and i swear i was like somebody is doing like voodoo shit on me or SOMETHING is going on that i cant explain -- that was so weird that happened

and then when i would write to u, 2018-2019 i was like SOMEONE is keeping u from seeing me, i dunno who but im going to figure it out, i had to figure it out bc it was personal ... i figured who ever it was, wanted to attack me personally, not professionally (tho its both), but at the personal level that what i knew

thats why i believe this https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&action=history all the updates, i believe it for what it is, 100% its in response to us meeting, everything -- and that shows you the epitome of white trash in this country, petty, average intelligence, all talk, will do the craziest shit over nothing personal, pure and complete white trash, all this over a resignation and two ... kids ... meeting 

i didnt say it in the voice note but i wanted him to hear it (oh i know), but he use to walk around like he was the manager of some used car dealership in like south central pennsylvania, like the middle of nowhere, absolute white trash and he would say things like "that aint gonna happen" yuck, so hes been acting like it too


the thought/intuition that i had in my head summer 2017 was "something really bad happened" -- thats why i believe this whole thing

i wasnt thinking of penn at all tho bc i wasnt there anymore! i returned everything in feb 2017 so like that would be crazy if i was thinking of those losers in like june 2017 in new jersey ... right

everybody around me (except my dad who said "i think you **want** to call him") said dont call you bc u didnt pick up my brother's calls (4 calls) and i was like ... theres something going on here, why are they looking at my CV (bc the link was on my CV only) and it said nyc .. oh thats a link to whenever someone clicks on my google scholar, i was like why are they doing that so interesting

so anyway, i dont need proof to know whats going on/what happened, i get it (brb in a couple of hrs)
