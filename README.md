# IAmStuckOnThisBCISawWhatYouWantedInApril2017-ItWasGenuine-IRememberThat-IGetIt

i never trusted anything that happened after we met in april 2017, it always seemed off, but i was like ... i cant do anything, my intuition all summer 2017 was like 1. something weird happened with that job not happening 2. someone is after me, i cant prove it, i cant explain, but something weird is happening and i was right

that summer 2017, my windshield on my car exploded, bc the guy who was trimming the hedges said he didnt touch my car that was parked, and i swear i was like somebody is doing like voodoo shit on me or SOMETHING is going on that i cant explain -- that was so weird that happened -- we thought it was a rock from a car that was passing by, some compete accident, and no we dont blame peoeple who come out to work for us, he said he saw it explode (he passed away from cancer last last year, RIP)

and then when i would write to u, 2018-2019 i was like SOMEONE is keeping u from seeing me, i dunno who but im going to figure it out, i had to figure it out bc it was personal ... i figured who ever it was, wanted to attack me personally, not professionally (tho its both), but at the personal level that what i knew

thats why i believe this https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jason_H._Moore&action=history all the updates, i believe it for what it is, 100% its in response to us meeting, everything -- and that shows you the epitome of white trash in this country, petty, average intelligence, all talk, will do the craziest shit over nothing personal, pure and complete white trash, all this over a resignation and two ... kids ... meeting 

i didnt say it in the voice note but i wanted him to hear it (oh i know), but he use to walk around like he was the manager of some used car dealership in like south central pennsylvania, like the middle of nowhere, absolute white trash and he would say things like "that aint gonna happen" yuck, so hes been acting like it too


the thought/intuition that i had in my head summer 2017 was "something really bad happened" -- thats why i believe this whole thing

i wasnt thinking of penn at all tho bc i wasnt there anymore! i returned everything in feb 2017 so like that would be crazy if i was thinking of those losers in like june 2017 in new jersey ... right

everybody around me (except my dad who said "i think you **want** to call him") said dont call you bc u didnt pick up my brother's calls (4 calls) and i was like ... theres something going on here, why are they looking at my CV (bc the link was on my CV only) and it said nyc .. oh thats a link to whenever someone clicks on my google scholar, i was like why are they doing that so interesting

so anyway, i dont need proof to know whats going on/what happened, i get it (brb in a couple of hrs)

i didnt know about the phd program until u told me about it on the phone, i swear i thought it was just a med school, i had no clue, but then like summer 2019, i didnt get in i was like why cant u respond to me, it HAS to be something bigger than than that ... but my intuition was when i moved to bethesda was to keep writing to you, when i was there, i was like, i feel like i should be in nyc i dunno, i cant explain it??

i saw this white trash loser crash out when i was asking him to write LORs in fall 2018 on twitter and my intuiton kept saying, its signal, its not noise, its about me, hes jealous/envious that im applying to competitive programs

ok brb in like 2 hrs

like it always felt like something was off about this whole thing and it wasnt you, like it was just something else

the first i dunno 30 seconds of me sitting in front of you my thoughts were: i just came back from umrah, if my mom finds out about this, she'll k i l l us BOTH ... literally both of us, she'll line us both up and we'll be d e a d, and you're going to get in a lot of trouble for this ... i know what you're doing ... so i wont say anything ... but u can look all you want LOL i was then thinking, like why are things here significantly better than where i was at, at penn, like ur telling me, i was fighting for that shit hole that i even moved out to, and right in my backyard in nyc was the best thing ever, life is weird like that i dunno

distracting myself bc my jobs are still PENDING ok brbbrbrbrbrbrbrb later lemme finish some things busy again brbrbrbrb

runnninggg the jobs are runningg omg the entire dayyyyyyyyyy sooo tomorrow is output dayyyy

oh yeah i was in my apartment in philly, i dunno may 2017 or something, i woke up one night and i was in the kitchen, alone maybe this was like 1 am or something, and i just had this like extreme extreme feeling that just something bad happened and i didnt know what it was like something bad was happening ... i told my mom about it and she said maybe i was stressed out bc of the moving, see i was right about all this. my mind at that time could have never have imagined that u guys reached out to penn, the absolute disrespect that shows towards someone would have just been unbelieveable to me, now i get it, i see it, its just a repeating pattern ... it is to be expected at this point, but back then i wouldnt have believed it
